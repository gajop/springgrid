NEW (currenT):
- separate AIs from their version, each AI should have (0, n) versions
- port 'delete request' for the queued matches to pylons (dexterthedevil 29.09.2011. : DONE 06.10.2011.)
- add match templates (everything that makes a match except for the concrete match ID)
- change the UI for "add league" - AIs should be selected using jquery multiselect instead of checkboxes (dexterthedevil 29.09.2011.)
- adding matches and mods manually needs to be changed; having the user specify hash is prone to errors
- add AI tests templates which should specify what kind of matches with what winning conditions an AI needs to play to satisfy it;
each test template should create a test (a group of matches and test result) when applied to an AI
- extend match model to allow for multiple AIs and teams; apply changes to both the UI and networking
- add automated match queries based on git changes

OLD (obsolete, left as a reference):
todo:
- add subscription to each league for each ai (?)
- add scheduler, to queue up matchrequests for each league (?)
- add results calculator (?)
- enforce no-cheating option in botrunner (?)
- some way of passing options through to ai (via script.txt?) (?)

list of options to handle:
- can an ai cheat?
- can an ai not cheat?
- league: cheating or not cheating?
- match: cheating or not cheating?
- custom options to pass through to an ai, on a per-match basis
- custom options to pass through to an ai, every time that ai plays
- add in ai configurations?  so an ai has an ai, and a config?
   - would have to be via the options in the script.txt
   - or actually could be more than that.  could be a specific config file
      ( and that config file could point to other config files)
   - or maybe could be a bunch of config files...
      - must be either .txt, .tdf or .xml files (or some other config file types)
      - path relative to ai path
      - config file locations specified by ai admin
- anyway for now could just have multiple ai versions...
  - for each ai version, need to specify whether it supports cheating, not cheating etc...

not sure if actually necessary (so: to test/investigate):
- add gameendstring to per-mod config

Addendum:
- specific AI, HughAI, now has startscript option "maphack=yes/no"
   - so, could add for HughAI, in the AILadder config:
      - state that it is possible to change maphack to different values
      - state that it is possible to run with maphack true, or maphack false
      - or.... maybe can have different configuration sets for HughAI
         - each configuration set can have different compatible league options, for example 'cheatingallowed'
