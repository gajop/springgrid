prerequisites
- have MySQL available
- have created a Mysql database, and have the name of a user and password for that database
- have a webserver capable of running python scripts in cgi (tested using apache2)
- have python installed
- have python MySQLdb installed
- have python sqlalchemy installed

setup
- the 'website' directory is the website, and should be published by using a virtual directory or similar
- make sure that the website directory is writable by the webserver
- connect to the website from your webbrowser, fill in your database connection details and click 'setup'

notes on apache2 setup for python scripts
- a possibly insecure but easy way to do this on a default apache2 installation on ubuntu
  is to edit /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default , and change the /var/www/ section as follows:

        <Directory /var/www/>
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews +ExecCGI
                AddHandler cgi-script cgi py
                AllowOverride None
                Order allow,deny
                allow from all
        </Directory>
- make sure that the .py files are executable, otherwise they may
  not execute correctly in cgi
